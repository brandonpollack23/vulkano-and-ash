After the tutorials are finished, I'll add my own "chapters" that will include
the following:

## Replace throw!s with results

## Do Ash Now

## More Generic Program
Things should be generic!
* Width
* Height
* Fullscreen
* Dont just print, offer logging ability instead
* Specify validation layers/debug mode
* Specify validation logging level
