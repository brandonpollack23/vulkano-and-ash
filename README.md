Take two at this comparison.

I hope to write a blurb for each chapter of
[vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Overview) comparing ash with
Vulkano to really help outline how "zero cost" Vulkano is (as well as learn it).

I've made a couple of game engine attempts in C++/Rust.

I think this time I'm not going to try to build an ECS/Game Engine while also
learning rendering, so I'm just going to learn Vulkan this time around.
