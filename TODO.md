After the tutorials are finished, I'll add my own "chapters" that will include
the following:

## Create a new final project for vulkano that organizes things effectively and is more modular
* remove allow dead code and use underscore names.
* fix warnings
* Extract classes
* create_swap_chain sub functions?

## Do Ash Now

## Replace prints with logging (and make an async logger?)

## FPS counter that prints every second

## Try CompositeAlpha changes on the swapchain.

## Replace throw!s with results

## More Generic Program
Things should be generic!
* Width
* Height
* Fullscreen
* Don't just print, offer logging ability instead
* Specify validation layers/debug mode
* Specify validation logging level
* Features/required extensions

## Make deps build in "release" mode to increase speed see [this](https://rust-gamedev.github.io/posts/newsletter-006/#rust-1-41-profile-overrides-are-stable-now)
